<h2>Introduction</h2>

Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

* **Reliable** - Load instantly even in uncertain network conditions.
* **Fast** - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
* **Engaging** - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen. More details about PWAs here: [https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)

The **WordPress Progressive Web Apps** plugin helps bloggers, publishers and other content creators to go beyond responsive web design and ‘appify' their existing mobile presence. Progressive Web Apps are supported on: iOS & Android. Compatible browsers: Safari, Google Chrome, Android – Native Browser. The plugin has been tested on WordPress 4.0 and later.

The WordPress Progressive Web Apps plugin includes one FREE mobile app theme (MOSAIC) which is customizable (colors, fonts, appearance) via the WordPress admin area. The tech stack we use in building Progressive Web Apps includes:

* AngularJS/Ionic
* ReactJS
* Sencha Touch
* SASS
* Gulp
* Bower
* Karma
* Jasmine
* Protractor


The MOSAIC mobile app theme (available for FREE) is built with Sencha Touch, but we're currently working on migrating it to AngularJS/Ionic 1. Most of the premium mobile app themes available at [PWAThemes.com/progressive-web-app-themes.html](https://pwathemes.com/progressive-web-app-themes.html) are built using Angular/Ionic 1 & SASS. Each mobile app theme comes with a "production" version, which in essence is the bundled/packaged/minified collection of all the necessary JS/CSS files for the PWA to run correctly.

Each of our mobile app themes are tested with Karma, Jasmine and Protractor. We have an average of 50-60% code coverage and we're working on improving this rate. While we do our best to catch any bugs out there, we are aware that some of them might escape us. Please reach out if you happen to come across a nasty one 😊.

The FREE mobile app theme MOSAIC available in the WordPress Progressive Web Apps plugin is the window-display of themes. You can instantly see several categories and choose which ones are of interest and focus on those. Depending on the number of displayed categories, the boxes will resize to fit all available space. It's great for publishers that have posts spanning several categories and need a way to visually structure their content.

It comes with support for:

* Multi-image mosaic on cover page
* Pages & sub-pages menu
* Side-to-side navigation with lateral swiping through categories
* Maximum 2 articles per page
